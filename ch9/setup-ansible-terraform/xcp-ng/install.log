🚀 Starting Minikube with Docker driver...
* minikube v1.37.0 on Ubuntu 22.04 (xen/amd64)
* Using the docker driver based on existing profile
* Starting "minikube" primary control-plane node in "minikube" cluster
* Pulling base image v0.0.48 ...
* Verifying Kubernetes components...
  - Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
* Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass

! /usr/local/bin/kubectl is version 1.31.0, which may have incompatibilities with Kubernetes 1.34.0.
  - Want kubectl v1.34.0? Try 'minikube kubectl -- get pods -A'
* Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
